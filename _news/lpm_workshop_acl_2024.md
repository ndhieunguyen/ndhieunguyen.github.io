[Language + Molecules @ ACL 2024 Workshop](https://language-plus-molecules.github.io/) is a workshop in [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/) with the topic of Synthesizing Language and Molecules for Scientific Insight and Discovery. There are 2 tasks in this workshop: generating a caption given a molecule and a molecule given a description. To solve the above tasks, we proposed 2 methods and both of them were accepted as poster presentations. They are listed below respectively.

- Duong Thanh Tran, Nhat Truong Pham, `Nguyen Doan Hieu Nguyen`, Balachandran Manavalan, [Mol2Lang-VLM: Vision- and Text-Guided Generative Pre-trained Language Models for Advancing Molecule Captioning through Multimodal Fusion](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ax8kYHfkNr)
- `Nguyen Doan Hieu Nguyen`, Nhat Truong Pham, Duong Thanh Tran, Balachandran Manavalan, [Lang2Mol-Diff: A Diffusion-Based Generative Model for Language-to-Molecule Translation Leveraging SELFIES Representation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=j9q7lurl7T)
