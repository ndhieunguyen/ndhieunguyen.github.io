[Language + Molecules @ ACL 2024 Workshop](https://language-plus-molecules.github.io/) is a workshop in [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/) with the topic of Synthesizing Language and Molecules for Scientific Insight and Discovery. There are 2 tasks in this workshop: generating a caption given a molecule and a molecule given a description. To solve the above tasks, we proposed 2 methods and both of them were accepted as poster presentations. They are listed below respectively. These methods are published in Association for Computational Linguistics
